  Grid lines rendered in sleek yellow over a translucent black backdrop with customizable spacing.

## 🎯 Purpose

**GridOverlay** is designed for developers, designers, and precision multitaskers who need a subtle but persistent visual alignment tool. The overlay floats above all content, offers immediate coordinate feedback, and doesn’t interfere with mouse interaction — perfect for multi-instance setups and UI debugging.
